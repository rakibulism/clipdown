## Features

- Download videos from 1000+ supported sites (via [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp))
- MP4 video or MP3 audio extraction
- Quality/resolution picker
- Bulk downloads — paste multiple URLs at once
- Automatic URL deduplication
- Clean, responsive UI — no frameworks, no build step
- Single Python file backend (~150 lines)

## Quick Start

```bash
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg    # or apt install ffmpeg && pip install yt-dlp
git clone https://github.com/rakibulism/clipdown.git
cd clipdown
./reclip.sh
```

Open **http://localhost:8899**.

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t clipdown . && docker run -p 8899:8899 clipdown
```

If you see `No such file or directory: 'yt-dlp'`, install it system-wide (`brew install yt-dlp` or `pip install yt-dlp`) or set `YT_DLP_BIN` to the binary path.

If YouTube returns `Sign in to confirm you’re not a bot`, provide cookies to yt-dlp:

```bash
# Option 1: exported Netscape cookies.txt
export YTDLP_COOKIES_FILE=/absolute/path/to/cookies.txt

# Option 2: read cookies from a local browser profile (yt-dlp syntax)
export YTDLP_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER=chrome
```

Clipdown automatically retries YouTube bot-check failures with yt-dlp's Android client profile first; if YouTube still blocks the request, configure one of the cookie options above.

## Deployment Notes (Vercel / Serverless)

- Clipdown runs best as a traditional long-running server (VM/container).
- On serverless platforms, filesystem writes are usually restricted to `/tmp`.
- Background in-memory jobs (`jobs = {}` + threads) are not durable across cold starts, so downloads can fail or disappear between requests.
- If you deploy serverless anyway, set `DOWNLOAD_DIR=/tmp/clipdown-downloads` and expect reduced reliability for long downloads.

## Usage

1. Paste one or more video URLs into the input box
2. Choose **MP4** (video) or **MP3** (audio)
3. Click **Fetch** to load video info and thumbnails
4. Select quality/resolution if available
5. Click **Download** on individual videos, or **Download All**
